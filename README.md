# Ilmomasiina

Ilmomasiina is the event registration system originally created by Athene, forked by Tietokilta, (forked by Teknologf√∂reningen :D) and currently under
heavy development for our new site. Once finished, it will be available for all organizations to use, along with
migration tools from the Athene-made version.

The latest development version is in the `dev` branch. **Please note that the code is currently in alpha phase.**
It likely has major bugs, and easy migrations will not be provided between versions until we reach beta.

## Contributing

Progress and planning is tracked in GitHub issues.
Please see and update the [project board](https://github.com/Tietokilta/ilmomasiina/projects/1) for ongoing work.

All help is appreciated. Please contact @PurkkaKoodari or another member of Tietokilta's Digitoimikunta if you wish to
actively help with development &ndash; there are still major changes to be done that may conflict with yours.
Start by reading the [docs](docs/README.md) to get familiar with the project.
